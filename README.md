# Color Guessing Game
The color of only one circle will match the RGB code randomized above them. If you click on wrong circle, it will disappear. Else if you click on the right one , the complete colors of the page will be turned to that color. There are two modes: Easy: Out of Six, only three circles will appear. Hard: All the six circles will appear.

### Prerequisites

Basic general knowledge of RGB color coding; a vague idea of color mixing would be enough. 
## Examples

```
HTML/CSS Name        Hex Code #RRGGBB	   Decimal Code (R,G,B)
Blue                 #0000FF	           (0,0,255)
Yellow	             #FFFF00	           (255,255,0)
Cyan/Aqua            #00FFFF         	   (0,255,255)
Magenta/Fuchsia      #FF00FF	           (255,0,255)
```

### Installing

The most common browser software titles on the market are: Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google's Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple's Safari, and Opera. Browser availability depends on the operating system your computer is using (for example: Microsoft Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, Mac OS, among others). Any of these can be utilized to run the Game.

## Running the tests

Upon clicking the "New Color" button, the colors will be randomized and a new color code will be formed.
